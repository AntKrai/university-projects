# University Projects

This repository contains my work from a series of Java programming labs, each focusing on different core concepts and tools in Java development. Below is a brief overview of each lab and the topics covered.

# Java

## Lab 1 & 2 – Introduction to Java and I/O

These initial labs focused on the basics of Java syntax and structure, with an emphasis on:

- Console input and output
- Using `Scanner` for user input
- Basic control structures (loops, conditionals)

## Lab 3 – Collections: Arrays and Maps

This lab introduced fundamental data structures in Java:

- Arrays and ArrayLists for dynamic storage
- HashSet for storing unique elements
- HashMap for key-value pair mapping

## Lab 4 – Gradle & Web Content Processing

In this lab, we learned how to build Java applications using **Gradle**. The main project was the **HTML Removing Application**, which:

- Downloaded data from a web page
- Stripped HTML tags
- Printed cleaned text to the terminal

## Lab 5 – File Operations & Unit Testing

This lab covered:

- Reading from and writing to files using Java I/O
- Modifying file contents and saving output to a new file
- Creating **JUnit tests** for a **Roots Calculator** application
- Continued use of **Gradle** for build automation and dependency management

## Lab 6 – Constructors & Subclasses

We explored object-oriented programming concepts including:

- Default, parameterized, and copy constructors
- Creating and using subclasses to extend functionality

## Lab 7 – Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Interfaces

This lab introduced more advanced OOP concepts:

- Abstract classes and method implementation
- Data encapsulation through access modifiers
- Class inheritance
- Defining and implementing interfaces
